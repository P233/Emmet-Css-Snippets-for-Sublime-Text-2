Emmet CSS Snippets Update

Thank you for using Emmet CSS Snippets.

* This package now contains two snippet versions: one with vendor prefixes, another one with plain property name. If you intend to use snippets with no prefix, add `has-Prefix` into the ignored_packages list of your settings file. The other way round, if you intend to use snippets with prefix, add `no-Prefix` into the ignored_packages list.

* Updated completion rule: propery snippes will no longer popup when you typing propery values.

* There are also a new cheat sheet available at http://p233.github.io/Emmet-Css-Snippets-for-Sublime-Text-2/

Enjoy coding!
